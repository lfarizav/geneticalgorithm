# Basic Genetic Algorithm

Copyright(c) 2017 Luis Ariza (lfarizav@gmail.com)

## Introduction

This repository shows how the Genetic Algorithm works. At the beginning it is a good deal to understand basic concept, before going to master leagues.
I hope this code will contribute to solve many basic questions about programming genetic algorithms.

## Build and Run

1.  Use `gcc -o algorithm test_algorithm.c algorithm.c population.c individual.c` to build the executable.
2.  Use `./algorithm` to run the algorithm.

Note: This code do not use SSE2/AVX intrinsic instruction (SIMD).
